# konami-code
Javascript to enable the Konami code on a website.

# What is the Konami Code?
It's a code that you used to put in to Konami-made game cartridges for the NES that would give you 99 lives.  To trigger it with the NES, you'd press up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A-Start.

# What does this script do?
Right now?  Nothing but logging "KONAMI!" to the console.  The intent here is to give you the framework to add it to your website.

# How do I trigger it without the Start button?
Use the enter key. 

# Libraries/Frameworks
None. Straight-up Javascript.

# Future Mods
Need to write the error trapping to ignore the Shift keys.
